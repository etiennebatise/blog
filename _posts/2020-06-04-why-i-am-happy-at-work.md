# Why I am happy today, as a developer? 

_TLDR: Because I own part of the company. Because we have a good impact on people’s life. Because we use logic and facts to make decisions (from top to bottom)._

## Introduction
Quick setup of who I am: my name is Etienne, I am a 26 yo developer, french, working in Paris. So, I am one of those "Millenials" everyone talks about recently. The lazy ones always complaining about the job and not respecting authority. Both of those statements were true about me until recently, and I’ll explain what changed.

_Spoiler alert_: I didn’t change a bit.

After going through different experiences, I realised that the are three pillars to my well-being:
1. Preparing for my future
2. Doing something good and helpful to people
3. Working with humble and loyal people

They are all equally important. These pillars don’t only apply to the workplace, although it is what I want to focus on here.

## 1. Preparing for my future
We leave in a capitalistic world. Money has a direct impact on the everyday sense of comfort, security and freedom. Building wealth is the path to financial freedom. I don’t expect from my boss to make me a millionaire in a month. All I expect from him is to be decent and not a selfish lying prick who wants to eat the whole cake by himself. I want my boss to elevate my condition as I elevate his/hers. I want a **delayed gratification**. 

The company I joined offered me shares.  I own my work. Of course, the value could go south, but it gives me an incentive to work hard now. That’s a gamble I am willing to make it and I will be the only one responsible for it. One of the reasons I am happy at work is that I am preparing for my future, with/for someone happy to help me do it.

## 2. Doing something good and helpful to people
I have worked for a big corporation. After several months, I understood that the real business was to sell human hours. Whatever the human, its time will do. And the clients were told wonders. The company would take any client willing to pay and milk the cow. That was so fucked up. I want to work for a company who cares about **helping people and aims for greatness**.

I joined a company that helps people get the best mortgage loan, in this disastrous user experience that is banking bureaucracy. Buying a house is a big deal, a big milestone in the life of everyone. It comes with a load of stress and insecurities. We are dedicated to making all that disappear. It’s not ending world hunger. But we have feedbacks from our former clients, praising their experience with us, recommending us to their friends and sending us photos of their new homes. One of the reasons I am happy at work is because we act to **changes people’s lives for the better**. 

1 and 2 give me the dedication to stay for the long run. To shape my life with the company in mind. Because I am convinced that I act for something good for me and others. But my everyday interactions with colleagues and management will also impact my happiness. 

## 3. Working with humble and loyal people
At another company, a big bunch of people had to create a new something-management system. There was a fundamental element of that system left undesigned and unscheduled. I wrote a draft about it, exposing the problem, providing solutions. My lead-dev and my manager validated. I was happy to take the lead on an important subject. But **the stakeholders ignored me**. There was no answer to my request. No consideration. Who was I, a mere developer, to speak to the great Architects and Product Owners? 

I joined a company where people use **facts** and **logic** to make decisions. We have no problem with admitting failures as long as we learn from them. We build trust by holding ourselves to our words. We value everyone’s opinion, and we don’t blame people. We work **as a team**.

## Conclusion

People say « Millenials » can’ respect authority. Rather, we don’t accept illogical, groundless decisions based on hierarchy. **We value logic over politics**.

People say « Millenials » always complain about the job. Rather, we want to **improve the world but we’re stuck**. Stuck rubbing the back of a very stubborn and entitled generation of do-nothing. Stuck, instead of tackling the problem we were told to solve when we grew up: climate change, inequalities, poverty, racism...

With 1, **I am at peace** because I am building my future and I know my time is not rented but invested. With 2, **I have a sense of purpose** because we do something good and helpful. With 3, **I can be at my full potential**, take the lead or ask for help, surrounded by humble, loyal and logical people.

That is why I am happy at work.
